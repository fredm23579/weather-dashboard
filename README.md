# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is a simple yet powerful application that provides real-time weather information. It allows users to search for a city and get both the current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast.

## Features

- Search for a city to get current weather conditions.
- View a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city.
- View the temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile view.
- Search history for quick re-access to previously searched cities.

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, simply enter the name of the city you wish to check the weather for and click on the "Search" button. The current weather and the 5-day forecast will be displayed on the screen. You can also click on any city name in the search history to quickly view the weather for that city again.
